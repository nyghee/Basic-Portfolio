            <p>As a new student of the University of Central Florida's Coding Boot Camp, I am excited to to become a Full Stack web developer and change my career. I'm currently the Owner Referral Training Manager at Westgate Resorts, where I oversee 10 locations nationwide. I've always had a love for computer science but was afraid to turn my interest into a career and end up losing joy for the subject. Now that I've joined the Boot Camp, I hope to continue my bachelor's degree in computer science with UCF. I believe that I will enjoy web developing but I ultimately wish to be supreme leader.</p>
